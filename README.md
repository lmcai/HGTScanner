## I. Prerequisites and installation

To process large datasets (>20 sp), high performance cluster is recommended. Mac and PC may suffer from insufficient memory during the assembly, alignment, or phylogenetic reconstruction. If you have difficulties installing PhyloHerb, please contact Liming Cai (lmcai@utexas.edu) or open an [Issue](https://github.com/lmcai/PhyloHerb/issues).
